## Data Science
In this section, will discuss the basics of data science using Python. There are several libraries in Python that we can use to process data, including numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, etc.

### Numpy 
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more

In this section, we will discuss numpy in several subsections including:
- Create A Numpy Array
- Index And Slice
- Concatening Arrays
- Numpy Essential
- Universal Functions
- Boolean Operations
- Aggregation
- Broadcasting

### Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

In this section, we will discuss matplotlib in several subsections including:
- Create Graphs With Matplotlib
- Generate Simple Graphs
- Visualize Uncertainity
- Customize Plots

### Seaborn
Seaborn is a library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs. It will be used to visualize random distributions. 

### Pandas 
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

In this section, we will discuss matplotlib in several subsections including:
- Transfer Data From Numpy To Pandas
- Get To Know Pandas
- Digging Into Dataframes
- Itterows Looping-For
- Index And Slice
- Filtering
- Adding A New Data To Dataframe
- Adding A new Columns to A Dataframe
